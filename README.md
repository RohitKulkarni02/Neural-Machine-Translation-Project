# Neural-Machine-Translation-Project
Got it. I’ll draft you a **technical, well-structured README** for your Neural Machine Translation (NMT) project (English → German, LSTM + Leaky GAN), similar in depth to top GitHub repos. Here’s a full version you can directly adapt:

# Neural Machine Translation (English → German)

This project implements a **Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system** for translating English sentences into German. It combines a **sequence-to-sequence model with LSTMs** and an **adversarial Leaky GAN setup** to improve translation fluency and robustness beyond standard encoder-decoder approaches.

## 🔑 Features

* **Encoder–Decoder with Attention**: Captures long-term dependencies for sentence-level translation.
* **Leaky GAN Integration**: Introduces an adversarial discriminator to encourage fluent and natural German outputs.
* **BLEU Evaluation**: Uses BLEU scores to evaluate translation quality.
* **Batch Processing**: Efficient training with mini-batches on GPU.
* **Inference Pipeline**: Supports beam search decoding for better translations.

## 🏗️ Architecture

1. **Encoder (LSTM)**

   * Tokenized English sentences converted to embeddings.
   * Multi-layer LSTMs capture contextual representations.

2. **Decoder (LSTM + Attention)**

   * Generates German translations one token at a time.
   * Attention mechanism aligns decoder outputs with relevant encoder states.

3. **Leaky GAN Component**

   * **Generator**: The Seq2Seq model acts as the generator.
   * **Discriminator**: A classifier distinguishes between human and model-generated German translations.
   * **LeakyReLU activations** used in the discriminator for stable training.

4. **Loss Function**

   * Translation loss: Cross-entropy between predicted and target tokens.
   * GAN loss: Binary cross-entropy to fool the discriminator.
   * Final loss = λ \* translation loss + (1-λ) \* adversarial loss.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Corpus**: 50,000 parallel English–German sentence pairs.
* **Preprocessing**:

  * Tokenization (using `spacy` or `nltk`).
  * Padding and truncation for uniform sequence lengths.
  * Vocabulary size limited to top 30,000 tokens.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/NMT-GAN-Translation.git
cd NMT-GAN-Translation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies:

* Python 3.x
* PyTorch
* NumPy, Pandas
* NLTK / SpaCy
* SacreBLEU (for evaluation)

## 🚀 Training

### Train Encoder–Decoder Model

```bash
python train_seq2seq.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 64 --lr 0.001
```

### Train with GAN Component

```bash
python train_gan.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 64 --lr 0.0005 --lambda 0.8
```

## 📈 Results

* **BLEU Score**: Achieved **18.5** on the test set.
* **Speed**: Processes 8–10 word sentences in under **2 seconds** on a T4 GPU.
* **Loss Curves**:

  * Seq2Seq baseline converges faster but generates rigid translations.
  * GAN-enhanced model produces more fluent, human-like German text.

## 🖥️ Inference Example

```python
from translate import Translator

model = Translator.load("models/nmt_gan.pt")
sentence = "The weather is nice today."
print(model.translate(sentence))
```

**Output:**

```
"Das Wetter ist heute schön."
```
